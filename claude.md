The user wants to create a Next.js AI application for interview 
  preparation. Looking at the image, I can see this is about the 
  "Topgrade Interview Prep Guide" for a company called Glia. The 
  interview format is about going through their professional journey 
  chronologically.

  The key questions/areas they need to prepare for include:
  1. Career moves and reasons
  2. Proudest accomplishments  
  3. What learned from challenges and feedback
  4. Signs of exceptional performance
  5. Magic questions like:
    - How did you find the job and who hired you?
    - What were you hired to do?
    - What was your manager like and how would they describe your 
  strengths/areas for growth?
    - What was your biggest win?
    - What was your toughest challenge?
    - Why did you leave?

  The user wants to:
  1. Create a database of answers to these questions
  2. Build a Next.js AI application where they can query their answers

  Since I'm in plan mode, I need to create a comprehensive plan for 
  this project without making any changes yet. The plan should 
  include:
  1. Setting up the Next.js project structure
  2. Creating a database/data structure for storing answers
  3. Building the AI interface to query the data
  4. Creating forms/interfaces to input and manage the data

  Let me create a detailed plan.

⏺ Based on the Topgrade Interview Prep Guide, I understand you want to
   build a Next.js AI application to help you prepare for your
  interview with Glia. The app needs to store and query answers to
  various interview questions about your professional journey.
